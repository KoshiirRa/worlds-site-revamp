    "body": "<em>Inspired by Stephen W.</em></p>\n<p>If your campaign is set during any part of the Reaper invasion, it's likely you'll need some\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Indoctrination\" target=\"_blank\">indoctrination</a> effects.\nWhile we encourage you to riff on these ideas or make up your own, here is a baseline for using indoctrination in your\ncampaign.</p>\n<p>Spending time in the presence of a creature or object that can cause indoctrination (namely, Reaper technology) can\nlead to a special condition called indoctrination. Indoctrination is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour\nperiod a creature spends within the presence of an indoctrinating source, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. If an already indoctrinated creature spends another\n24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC of the saving throw increases as described below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Next Wisdom DC</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>You have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows. To gain the benefits of a long rest takes an additional 4 hours.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>You begin showings signs of paranoia, having feelings of being watched. You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>You have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>You begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>The voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>You become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h3>Reducing Indoctrination Levels</h3>\n<p>Every long rest that a creature spends outside of the range of an indoctrinating source, it can make a new\nWisdom saving throw (DC based on its current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce its indoctrination level by 1.</p>\n<p>Note: Synthetic creatures are immune to indoctrination.</p>\n<h3>Reaper Tech</h3>\n<p>Usually, indoctrination happens when another creature (such as a reaper, thorian, or leviathan) is actively trying to\nindoctrinate one or many creatures. An exception to this is Reaper technology (i.e., reaper parts or devices salvaged from\nbattle or space). Reaper technology can passively indoctrinate creatures that are merely in the technology's presence.\nDetermining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size.\nThe larger the object, the farther the range.</p>\n<h4>Distance of Indoctrination</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Size of tech</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>10 meters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>25 meters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>100 meters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1 kilometer (~ 1/2 a mile)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>10 kilometers (~ 6 miles)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>100 kilometers (~ 60 miles)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"

    "body": "Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a\ncrest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or\ngender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction\ninitiated by a &quot;mind meld&quot; which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to\nrandomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to\nmanipulate mass effect fields.</p>\n<h2>Unmatched Patience</h2>\n<p>Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a &quot;long view&quot; not common in other races. When they encounter a new\nspecies or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.\nThey invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will\ninevitably influence the existing culture.</p>\n<h2>Mothers of the Galaxy</h2>\n<p>Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the\nasari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA.\nThe offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead,\nthe asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and\nas a &quot;map&quot; to randomize the genes of the offspring.</p>\n<p>Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the &quot;father&quot; from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown\nupon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so\nit's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as\n&quot;purebloods&quot;, a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes\nasari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.</p>\n<h2>Maiden, Matron, Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The <strong>Maiden</strong> stage\nbegins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and\nit is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The <strong>Matron</strong>\nstage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This\nperiod is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The <strong>Matriarch</strong> stage begins around 700 years\nof age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors,\ndispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.\nHowever, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.</p>\n<h2>Asari Names</h2>\n<p>Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari\nparents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with\ntheir personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as &quot;Matriarch&quot; but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Names</strong>: Aeian, Aethyta, Aleena, Alestia, Aria, Batha, Benezia, Dahlia, Falere, Irissa, Jona, Liara, Lidanya,\nLiselle, Mallene, Morinth, Nassana, Nyxeris, Pelessaria, Rana, Rila, Samara, Sarissa, Shiala, Tela, Tevos, Treeya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames</strong>: Ateyne, B'Sayle, Calis, D'Layne, D'Nava, D'Ysesan, Dantius, Iallis, Iasava, Janieri, Kelis, M'Loari, M'Taros,\nMakenus, Nuwani, Sedela, Sederis, T'Goni, T'Loak, T'Soni, Thanoptis, Theris, V'Lanis, V'Nato, V'Tizor, Vasir</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"2-3\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Asari'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n Asari are very long-lived and can reach ages of over 1000 years.

Drell have integrated with every\nlevel of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact.\nMany drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' &quot;soul names&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Language of Lights</h2>\n<p>The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness.\nOther species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order\nto perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper\nlanguage and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.</p>\n<h2>Hanar Names</h2>\n<p>The hanar have two names, a &quot;face name&quot; and a &quot;soul name.&quot; The face name is used as a general label for use by\nstrangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.</p>\n<p><strong>Face Names</strong>: Anrynder, Delanynder, Ellanpo, Hymydwhyn, Lopyldis, Malvyll, Opold, Sedlyner, Tolystoyl, Wynold, Zymandis</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Names</strong>: Burns Brightest when the Foam Blooms, Casts Shadow on the Sun Flower, Emancipates the Tide from those that Pull,\nHeeds only to the Inner Lights, Illuminates the Folly of the Dancers, Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair,\nTransforms the Stone into Water</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"Hanar\" source=\"wiki\"></source-reference></p>\n Hanar usually reach maturity around 40 years and typically live to be 180 years old. Most hanar are lawful due to the religious influence on their society. Due to their long tentacles, hanar \"stand\" about as tall as humans. Their bodies are around 1.5 meters long (4-5'). Your size is Medium. Hanar are a water-based lifeform and have a swim speed of 10m. They rely on contra-gravitic levitation packs when not in water environments.

The krogan managed to not only survive on their\nunforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more\ntechnologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war\nthat reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.</p>\n<h2>Biologically Impervious</h2>\n<p>Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous\nplates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,\nfor the resources in Tuchanka are scare.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These\ntraits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as &quot;Blood Rage.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Blood Rage</h2>\n<p>The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless\nkilling machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and\nsuppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant\norgans, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.</p>\n<h2>Climb Atop the Dead</h2>\n<p>Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule\nand the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power.\nEven within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and\nwill sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and\nlive in clans separate from the males.</p>\n<h2>Rites and Rituals</h2>\n<p>The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his\nfirst clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor.\nWhen facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.</p>\n<p>A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and\ntorturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan\nand are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit\nworld itself.</p>\n<h2>Krogan Names</h2>\n<p>Krogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Archuk, Brood, Charr, Drax, Fortak, Grunt, Guld, Jarrod Nax, Okeer, Skarr, Strux, Uvenk, Wreav, Wrex</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Bakara, Chormi, Derge, Hazka, Jonde Kesh, Khorga, Kherake, Morda, Tegash, Vruxa, Zrogoga</p>\n<p><strong>Clan Names</strong>: Garbon, Gatatog, Jorgal, Khutarum, Nakmor, Srarkan, Traash, Urdnot, Verbok, Weryloc, Wudark</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"6-7\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Krogan'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n Krogan can live well over a thousand years due to their natural hardiness.

    "body": "The Protheans are an ancient alien race which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a\nsingle planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known\nabout them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.</p>\n<h2>Ancient Empire</h2>\n<p>After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from\nthose ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the\ngalaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.</p>\n<p>Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them.\nTo defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire.\nThe other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.</p>\n<h2>Reaper Invasion</h2>\n<p>The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the\nReapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They\nwere caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the\nCitadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems\nfrom one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.</p>\n<h2>Stasis</h2>\n<p>In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could\nhold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.\nUnfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control\nthese facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,\nthe number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden\nbunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.</p>\n<h2>All Eyes on You</h2>\n<p>As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of\nspeech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your\nway wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued\nby your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.</p>\n<h2>Avatars</h2>\n<p>Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular\nvirtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice,\nmercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,\nit is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint\nyour own virtue.</p>\n<h2>Prothean Names</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor.

    "title": "Quarian",
    "body": "Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the\nseas in search of a new homeland.</p>\n<h2>Exotic Fashion</h2>\n<p>Identifying a quarian is easy. All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from\nforeign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem\nfeatured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they\nwere also burdened to life in a suit.</p>\n<p>The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen\nwithout their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their\nsuit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.</p>\n<h2>Exiles of their Own Creations</h2>\n<p>Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as &quot;Geth,&quot; meaning &quot;Servant of the People&quot;. These\nconstructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the\nquarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.</p>\n<p>The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly\ncomplex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians\nattempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated.\nWith many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.</p>\n<h2>Cybernetic Improvements</h2>\n<p>Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering\nand technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended\nfrom or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally\nsmall, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to\nthose without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device\nis part of their sending off ceremony.</p>\n<h2>Migrant Fleet</h2>\n<p>The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those\nwho escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy\nstrip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their\nown goals but normally return to the fleet.</p>\n<p>When young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel\nto ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.</p>\n<h2>The Pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is\nreached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the\nflotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as\nresources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are\nthose who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.</p>\n<h2>Quarian Names</h2>\n<p>Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the\nname of their vessel preceeded by a title - &quot;nar&quot; to denote their birth ship and &quot;vas&quot; to denote their post-pilgrimage ship.\nFor example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Golo, Han, Hilo, Kal, Kar, Keenah, Kenn, Lemm, Les, Prazza, Rael, Seeto, Shio, Veetor, Ysin, Zaal, Zer</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Ceni, Daro, Elan, Feda, Jura, Laele, Lia, Meeri, Minn, Reen, Saesa, Shala, Shuni, Tali, Yosi, Zohe,</p>\n<p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Breizah, Dannah, Gazu, Gerral, Hodda, Jaa, Koris, Leth, Mal, Mekk, Nara, Raan, Reegar, Shaal, Shiya, Vael, Xen, Zorah</p>\n<p><strong>Vessel Names</strong>: Honorata, Idenna, Moreh, Neema, Novarra, Qwib Qwib, Rayya, Tesleya, Tonbay, Ulnay, Usela</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"8-9\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Quarian'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n Quarians have lifespans similar to humans.

    "body": "Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a\nsuper-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other races while requiring less rest.\nAdditionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly\ntinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.</p>\n<h2>Hyperactive Metabolism</h2>\n<p>The speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The race only requires only one hour of sleep a\nnight, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other races. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster.\nThey talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has\nadvanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.</p>\n<h2>Boredom, the Mother of Invention</h2>\n<p>Salarians minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored.\nTinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations,\nand possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially\nin electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft he puts his mind to.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>\n<p>Invention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and\nknowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A\nphotographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very\nskilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these\ntrades are viable life paths.</p>\n<h2>One Mother Among Sons</h2>\n<p>Salarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According\nto ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male.\nRomantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction.\nAs females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political\npower in a complex matriarchal government.</p>\n<h2>Matriarchal Feudalism</h2>\n<p>Salarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her\ndaughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory\nknown as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble\nmatrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian\nis loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.</p>\n<h2>Intense Curiosity</h2>\n<p>Despite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females,\nhowever, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories,\nthough some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and\npursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new\nlives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.</p>\n<h2>Salarian Names</h2>\n<p>Salarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march,\nduchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless\nnecessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Full Names</strong>: Rannadril Ghan Swa Fulsoom Karaten Narr Eadi Bel Anoleis, Gorot II Heranon Mal Dinest Got Inoste Ledra</p>\n<p><strong>Given Names</strong>: Beelo, Chorban, Esheel, Ish, Jarroth, Jarun, Jondum, Kallo, Kirrahe, Maelon, Mordin, Morlan, Padok, Palon, Rentola, Schells, Solik, Tazzik, Tolan, Valern, Zevin</p>\n<p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Aenarth, Aulaw, Bau, Erkoln, Faergow, Gurji, Heplorn, Inoste, Irheth, Jath, Jowar, Marhall, Raeka, Sernik, Solus, Tann, Vass, Venirn, Vodol, Wiks, Yosann</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"10-11\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Salarian'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n Salarians have an extremely high metabolism that causes a short life span. Salarians rarely reach ages over 40 years of age. Salarians can have dubious morals, especially when it comes to experiments and advancing technology. Neutrality is a common alignment for salarians.

The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian\nrace is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with.\nDespite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble race.</p>\n<h2>Discipline and Honor</h2>\n<p>The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal\nresponsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own\npersonal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs.\nThey are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to\nlie about their actions. Because of this, many races attribute to them a &quot;turian honor&quot; seen rarely outside the turian race.</p>\n<h2>Proud Warrior Race</h2>\n<p>At the center of turian society is their military.

There are tiers of citizenship, with\nthe lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client races and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs\nwhich lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking\nones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks.

Turians have evolved semi-metallic\ncarapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however,\ndo not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.</p>\n<h2>Mission or Desertion</h2>\n<p>Most Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions.\nSome, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command.\nThose who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.</p>\n<h2>Turian Names</h2>\n<p>Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name.

The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has\nmade volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance.\nMany of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the\nElkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were\nresponsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the &quot;credit&quot; as the standard currency of interstellar\ntrade.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending\ntheir credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,\nsometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never\nspent a cred.</p>\n<h2>Council Seat</h2>\n<p>Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the\nCouncil. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need\nto have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the\nKrogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster,\nnone of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction\nof well-armed dreadnoughts.</p>\n<h2>Volus Names</h2>\n<p>Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family\nname would essentially be laying claim to their offspring.</p>\n<p><strong>Names</strong>: Ano Vot, Berla Mon, Bovan Set, Ceron, Cihaan, Din Mark, Dovan Hal, Eppo Wen, Han Olar, Jahleed,\nJahve Kormat, Kelan Vot, Kora Bos, Lona Osar, Levan Lih, Meeve Wen, Morten Sov, Olot For, Pitne Wit, Reema Po, Tahluud, Vaner Jok</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"Volus\" source=\"wiki\"></source-reference></p>\n Most volus reach adulthood around their 50th year and live to be around 200 years-old. Volus society tends towards lawful as a whole, with clans fighting over economic resources and aggressive negotiating, even if they are individually chaotic individuals. They tend towards neutral morality. Volus are between 1 and 1.5 metes (3-4'). Your size is Small. Your base walking speed is 8m. Instead of your class's starting equipment, 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment."

    "title": "Vorcha",
    "body": "The vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural\nresources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a\ntight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce\nresources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic\nnecessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which\npreceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.</p>\n<h2>Non-differentiated cells</h2>\n<p>The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found\non the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to\nadapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive\nin high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly\n(~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.</p>\n<h2>Clan Violence</h2>\n<p>Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their\ndefault form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with\nothers of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large,\nyounger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The vorcha are extremely aggressive, both against rivals of\ntheir own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who have managed to escape their\nhomeworld have a tendency to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger spaceships.</p>\n<h2>Vorcha Names</h2>\n<p>Like their lifespans, vorcha names are brutal and short.</p>\n<p><strong>Male names</strong>: Besk, Drent, Dist, Flesk, Grank, Grote, Gryll, Jerst, Kreete, Shisk, Tirst, Tregg,</p>\n<p><strong>Female names</strong>: Ast, Brytt, Eesk, Fleeg, Ift, Ish, Keet, Kiv, Pash, Pritt, Shate, Tath</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"Vorcha\" source=\"wiki\"></source-reference></p>\n Vorcha have extremely short lifespans and only live for 20 years. They reach adulthood shortly after their first year. Most vorcha are chaotic evil or almost always chaotic even if their morality is strengthened. Vorcha are taller on average than humans (though they naturally slouch) and relatively slender. Your size is Medium. Your base walking speed is 14m. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 4d12 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment."

    "body": "The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e\ntakes that storytelling to the stars. Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,\nD&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how an\nN7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p>\n<v-alert :value=\"true\" type=\"info\">\nIn Mass Effect 5e, the Dungeon Master is called the Galaxy Master (tm tm tm)\n</v-alert>\n<br>\n<p><simple-card><template slot=\"text\">\n<strong>Galaxy Master (GM)</strong>: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile\nlock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite\nside of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defensive system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears\nto be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals\non your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge\nof the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in …\n<br>\n<strong>Amanda (playing Melphine)</strong>: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.\n<br>\n<strong>Amie (playing Telos)</strong>: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far?

Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,\nroll away from the strike of a biotic blase, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,\nbut the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>\n<p><simple-card><template slot=\"text\">\n<strong>Galaxy Master (GM)</strong>: OK, one at a time.

Eight.\n<br>\n<strong>GM</strong>: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?\n</template></simple-card></p>\n<p>In the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other\noperatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,\nthe glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.\nThe operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies\nand relics from a past age.</p>\n<p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates\nmissions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the\nentrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?\nPropel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, &quot;affixing&quot; themselves to the surface of\nthe asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM\ncan improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each\nmission can be exciting and unexpected.</p>\n<p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a\n<strong>campaign</strong>. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends\nevery week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each\nmonster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also\nearns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.</p>\n<p>There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.\nTogether, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an\noperative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,\nthe other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the\nplayer might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,\nbut if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"2\" source=\"basic\"></source-reference></p>\n"

The Milky Way has been settled by sentient beings for millennia and most of\nits clusters, star systems, and planets have been charted and explored. It also is home to a variety of sentient alien species\nall with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar\nwith the first Mass Effect 3 video games, you can read about major events and lore at the\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect Wiki</a>. Specifically, the\n<A href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline\" target=\"_blank\">timeline</a> can get you quickly up to speed to the events\nof the galaxy.</p>\n<p>The Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of &quot;Remnant&quot; seem to exist on every planet, connected\nby seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient races existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way\nraces. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way\nraces arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like\nto read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda, <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda#Setting\" target=\"_blank\">\nthe wiki</a> has plenty of information.</p>\n<p>Both galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but\neach galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.\nYou could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign\non the timeline, you might also deal with the impending invasion of <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper\" target=\"_blank\">the Reapers</a>.\nIn contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of\nsetting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way\nis an urban setting and Andromeda is rural.</p>\n<p>Your GM might set the campaign on one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so\nmuch diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house\nrules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,\neven if the setting is a published world.</p>\n<v-alert :value=\"true\" type=\"info\">\nIt is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies.

    "title": "How to Play",
    "id": "how_to play",
    "body": "The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>\n<h3>1. The GM describes the environment.</h3>\n<p>The GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that\npresent themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).</p>\n<h3>2. The players describe what they want to do.</h3>\n<p>Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different\noperatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol\nspray painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens\nto every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say\nthat the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some\nother circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what\nhappens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>\n<h3>3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.</h3>\n<p>Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>\n<p>This pattern holds whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or\nlocked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is\nmore structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is\nfluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.</p>\n<p>Often the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal\ndescriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many\nplayers and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the\ngame. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a\nscene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>\n<h3>Game Dice</h3>\n<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many\nbookstores.</p>\n<p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,\nand d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>\n<p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different\nten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the\nones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are\nnumbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.\nIn this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>\n<p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.\nFor example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>\n<p>The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the\nnumber rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on\nwhether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)</p>\n<h3>The D20</h3>\n<p>Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari\nbelieve an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation\ngrenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,\nthe game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters\nmight have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are\nthe basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>\n<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of\nthe game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>\n<h4>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</h4>\n<p>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and\nit sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See\n<nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/character-creation\">Step-By-Step Characters</nuxt-link> for details on each ability and how to determine an\nability’s modifier.)</p>\n<h4>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</h4>\n<p>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>\n<h4>3. Compare the total to a target number.</h4>\n<p>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,\nit’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>\n<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <strong>Difficulty Class (DC)</strong>. The target number for an\nattack roll is called an <strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>.</p>\n<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>\nprovides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>\n<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.\nAdvantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you\nhave either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if\nyou have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17\nand a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the\n<nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#advantage-and-disadvantage\">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> section.</p>\n<h3>Specific Beats General</h3>\n<p>This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,\ngadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how\nthe rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every\nsoldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking\nare more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.\nBiotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>\n<h3>Round Down</h3>\n<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you\nend up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"3-4\" source=\"basic\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "body": "The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each\ncharacter brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,\nracial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best\nparty of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.\nThe operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.</p>\n<p>The mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic\nsetting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It\nfeatures a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as\nnonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras\nin a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.</p>\n<p>Over the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations\nthat they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture\neach other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And\noften, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the\ncurrent situation. Meanwhile, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what\nthey’ll try to do next.</p>\n<p>missions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no\nmore than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other\nchallenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end\nof a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of\ntheir labors.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of\nmultiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group\nof operatives following the narrative from start to finish.</p>\n<h3>The Three Pillars of mission</h3>\n<p><strong>Exploration</strong> includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations\nthat require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters\nto do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result.

And most races had an\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Ark#Arks\" target=\"_blank\">Ark</a> for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy.\nAnd in some rare cases, a small group of a race may have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Batarian_Scrapper\" target=\"_blank\">were recruited</a>\nas security assets on Ark Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that\nwe've deemed inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master.\nSee the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/intro#universe-to-explore\">A Universe to Explore</nuxt-link> section for more information about the two Galaxies.\n<h3 class=\"mt-3\">Class Restrictions <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\nIn Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. Instead of making our own distinctions\nabout what races can play what classes, we used the race/class combinations available in the\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_Multiplayer/Character_Customization\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect 3</a>\nand <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda_Multiplayer#Character_Customization\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>\nmultiplayer systems.\n<h4>Recommendation, not Law</h4>\n<p>However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are <em>not</em> based on game balance. Therefore, you are\nencouraged to talk to your Galaxy Masters about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the decision\nconcerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, the\n<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Biotics\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect Wiki's page about biotics</a> has\na breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race.

Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she\npossesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging\nin a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the <a href=\"/phb/classes\">Classes</a> section.</p>\n<p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities\n(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of\nproficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things\nyour character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>\n<p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level</p>\n<h3>Level</h3>\n<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A\n1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate\nand done dangerous things before.</p>\n<p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the\ngame, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the\nassumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.</p>\n<p>Record your level on your character sheet.

A higher-level\ncharacter typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).</p>\n<h3>Hit Points and Hit Die</h3>\n<p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points\nare determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>\n<p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal\nto the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which\nyou’ll determine in step 3.)

Occasionally, your proficiency\nbonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.

Four categories of characteristics are\npresented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s\nfavorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Each background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your\nimagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n<p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart\nfrom every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.\nThey should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.\n“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells\nyou something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.</p>\n<p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character\ndislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p>\n<p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define\none trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,\nor be cocky about your high score.</p>\n<h3>Ideals</h3>\n<p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental\nmoral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.</p>\n<p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to\nmake sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p>\n<p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background\nincludes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.\nThe last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>\n<h3>Bonds</h3>\n<p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.\nThey tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against\nyour own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations\nand goals.</p>\n<p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?\nWhat is your most treasured possession?</p>\n<p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or\npersonality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.</p>\n<h3>Flaws</h3>\n<p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to\nrealize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p>\n<p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining\na level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For\nexample, if you have three levels in engineer and two in sentinel, you're a 5th-level character.</p>\n<p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another\nclass, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start\nprogressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some\nfocus in exchange for versatility.</p>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your\nnew one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into\nthe infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher.

So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP\nto reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a\nclass only when you are a 1st-level character.</p>\n<p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same\ndie type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a\nsentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them\nseparately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.</p>\n<h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer spells.

See an\nability's description in the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/appendix/skills\">Appendix: Skills</nuxt-link> for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p>\n<h4>Strength</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Athletics</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Dexterity</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Acrobatics</li>\n<li>Sleight of Hand</li>\n<li>Stealth</li>\n<li>Vehicle Handling</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Intelligence</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronics</li>\n<li>Engineering</li>\n<li>History</li>\n<li>Investigation</li>\n<li>Science</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Wisdom</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Insight</li>\n<li>Medicine</li>\n<li>Perception</li>\n<li>Survival</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Charisma</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Deception</li>\n<li>Intimidation</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Persuasion</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”\nAt other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,\nproficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that\nskill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>\n<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If\nthe character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character\nlacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>\n<h4 class=\"m-3 subheading\">Variant: Paragon & Renegade <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h4>\nIn Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/beyond-first-level#paragon-renegade\">Variant: Paragon & Renegade</nuxt-link>.\nThis new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is \"Paragon-ish\"\nor \"Renegade-ish\".\n<p></p>\n<h3>Passive Checks</h3>\n<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the\naverage result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when\nthe GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a\nhidden sniper.</p>\n<p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check\ntotal as a score.</p>\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom\n(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the <a href=\"#dexterity\">Dexterity</a> section below rely on passive checks, as do\nthe exploration rules.</p>\n<h3>Working together</h3>\n<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the\nhighest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.\nIn combat, this requires the <strong>Help</strong> action.</p>\n<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a\nsecurity system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another\ncharacter in that task.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some\ntasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.</p>\n<h4>Group Checks</h4>\n<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.\nIn such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p>\n<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,\nthe whole group succeeds.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters\nsucceed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group\nWisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the\nenvironment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of\ndanger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"77-79\"></source-reference></p>\n"

The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\nThese weights have been adjusted from 5th Edition to work with kilograms (kg) instead of pounds (lbs).\n<br>\n<strong>Carry Capacity</strong>. You can carry capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 5. If you are wearing armor, your carry\ncapacity is your Strength score multiplied by 10 (due to the built-in servos and pneumatics). This score is not affected\nby weapons or armor (see below).\n<br>\n<strong>Push, Drag, Lift</strong>.

Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category\nabove Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\n<br>\n<strong>Weapons</strong>. You have 4 weapon slots and can equip a single weapon in any slot. <em>Two-handed</em> weapons require 2 weapon slots.\nWeapons equipped in a slot do not affect your carry capacity.

Initiative determines the order of\ncreatures' turns in combat.</p>\n<h3>Hiding</h3>\n<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.\nUntil you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any\ncreature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>\n<p>You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as\nshouting a warning or bumping into a crate. An <em>invisible</em> creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still\nbe noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>\n<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature,\nit usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature\nthat is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive Perception</strong>. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine\nwhether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom\n(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the\ncreature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency\nbonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)\nof 14.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can You See?</strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how\nwell you can see in an area, which might be <em>lightly</em> or <em>heavily obscured</em>.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"80-81\"></source-reference></p>\n"

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the\ncreatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.</p>\n<h3>Speed <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h3>\n<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in meters that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.\nThis number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The\ntable states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes\ncharacters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>\n<h4>Forced March</h4>\n<p>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,\nand each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.\nOn a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>\n<h4>Mounts and Vehicles</h4>\n<p>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted\ncharacter can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are\navailable every 12 to 15 kilometers (8-10 miles), characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very\nrare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Characters in transports choose a pace as normal. The <strong>range</strong> statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can\ntravel in a 24 hour period for a <em>normal</em> pace. If you're moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a\nslow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.\nIn general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.</p>\n<p>More details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/vehicles\">vehicles</nuxt-link> section.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Travel Pace table\" component=\"travel-pace\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.\nBut operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -\nall considered difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving 1 meter in difficult terrain costs 2 meters of speed - so you can\ncover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h3>Special Types of Movement</h3>\n<p>Movement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives\nmight have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>\n<h4>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h4>\n<p>While climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs 1 extra meter (2 extra meters in difficult terrain), unless a\ncreature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few\nhandholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require\na successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<h4>Jumping <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h4>\n<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Jump</strong>. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to your Strength score divided by three (rounded up)\nif you move at least 4 meters on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.\nEither way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.</p>\n<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,\nyou must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),\nsuch as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>\n<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>\n<p><strong>High Jump</strong>. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 1 + your Strength modifier divided by three\n(rounded up) if you move at least 4m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can\njump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances,\nyour GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>\n<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal\nto the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.</p>\n<h4>+/- Gravity <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h4>\n<p>Operatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that\nis twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. I.e., if your\noperative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>If you're in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher\ngravity.</p>\n<p>When in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself. Additional rules, such as\ndisadvantage on Dexterity saving throws or melee attacks, are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"84-85\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "id": "the_environment",
    "body": "Going on missions can involve delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of environmental hazards. The rules\nin this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p>\n<h3>Falling</h3>\n<p>A fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a\nfall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 4 meters (~10 ft) it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature\nlands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>\n<h3>Suffocating</h3>\n<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier\n(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit\npoints or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>\n<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2\nrounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h3>Space <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>The vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synthorganic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature\nhas some specific resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space without an appropriate environmental\nsuit will remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). After that time passes,\nthe creature immediate becomes incapacitated and it can survive in space a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution\nmodifier (minimum 1) after which it dies.</p>\n<h3>Vision and Light</h3>\n<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and\ntargeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects\nthat obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>\n<p>A given area might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured</strong>. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog,\nor moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n<p>A <strong>heavily obscured</strong> area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature\neffectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.</p>\n<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: <strong>bright light</strong>, <strong>dim light</strong>,\nand <strong>darkness</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and\nother sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between\na source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts\nas dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict\nstarship, or a subterranean ruin.</p>\n<h4>Blindsight</h4>\n<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures\nwithout eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have\nthis sense.</p>\n<h4>Darkvision</h4>\n<p>Some creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision\ncan see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that\ncreature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<h4>Truesight <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h4>\n<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that\nare hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).</p>\n<h4>Infrared vision <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h4>\n<p>A creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured\nareas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.</p>\n<p>However, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.</p>\n<h3>Food and Water</h3>\n<p>Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be\nremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>\n<h4>Food</h4>\n<p>A character needs about 500 grams (~ 1lb) of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.\nEating 250 grams of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>\n<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the\nend of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating\nresets the count of days without food to zero.</p>\n<h4>Water</h4>\n<p>A character needs 2 liters (~ 1/2 gallon) of water per day, or 4 liters per day if the weather is hot. A character who\ndrinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at\nthe end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end\nof the day.</p>\n<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>\n<h3>Interacting with Objects</h3>\n<p>A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM\nthat his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,\nhappens.</p>\n<p>For example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or\ngive the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need\nto hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can\nbypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>\n<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,\nbut otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class\nand hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.\n(It's hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and\nthey are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>\n<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"86-87\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "title": "Social Interaction",
    "id": "social_interaction",
    "body": "Exploring planets, overcoming obstacles, and surviving death squads are key parts of Mass Effect missions. No less important,\nthough, are the social interactions that operatives have with other inhabitants of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous spy to confess to some malfeasance, or you\nmight try to flatter a shop owner so they will give you a discount. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are\nparticipating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a\n<strong>nonplayer character</strong> (NPC).</p>\n<p>In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are\npredisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a\nfriendly NPC, of course.</p>\n<p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p>\n<h3>Roleplaying</h3>\n<p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character\nthinks, acts, and talks.</p>\n<p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s\nquirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p>\n<p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most\nplayers use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.</p>\n<h4>Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</h4>\n<p>With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental\nimage of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p>\n<p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li>\n<li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.</li>\n<li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li>\n<li>Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing\nwhat you see in your mind.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h4>Active Approach to Roleplaying</h4>\n<p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying\nshows them.</p>\n<p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even\necho your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though\nyou still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.</p>\n<h4>Results of Roleplaying</h4>\n<p>The GM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats\nof violence. A stubborn turian refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain asari laps up flattery.</p>\n<p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality.\nYou might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence\nthe NPC’s attitude.</p>\n<p>Interactions in Mass Effect 5e are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten\nthem with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want.\nOn the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a politician’s allies, your efforts to convince or\ndeceive will fall short.</p>\n<h3>Ability Checks</h3>\n<p>In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p>\n<p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation.\nFor example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play\na role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in\nyour favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a security guard\ninto letting them into a classified area, the infiltrator who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the\ndiscussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the sentinel with Persuasion should do most of the talking.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"66-67\" source=\"basic\"></source-reference></p>\n"

They need rest - time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, clean their weapons, practice biotic spells, and configure\nomni-tools.</p>\n<p>Operatives can take short rests in the midst of mission day and a long rest to end the day.</p>\n<h3>Short Rest</h3>\n<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than\neating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p>\n<p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice,\nwhich is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the\ncharacter's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to\nspend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest,\nas explained below.</p>\n<h3>Long Rest</h3>\n<p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light\nactivity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period\nof strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting biotics, or similar activity - the characters must\nbegin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>\n<p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a\nnumber of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character\nhas eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p>\n<p>A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit\npoint at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"87\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "body": "Between trips to remote planets and battles against reaper forces, operatives need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare\nfor their next mission. Many operatives also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting or modding arms and\narmor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned credits.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new mission,\nthe GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your\ncharacter has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond\nyour perception stay in motion.</p>\n<h3>Lifestyle Expenses</h3>\n<p>Between missions, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other\nindividuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to\ninfluence the officials of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Lifestyle Expenses\" component=\"lifestyle-expenses\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<h3>Downtime Activities</h3>\n<p>Between missions, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can\nvary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit,\nand at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be\nconsecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer\nperiod of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>\n<p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her\ndowntime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>\n<h4>Crafting</h4>\n<p>You can craft weapons, mods, armor, other equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the\nobject you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations\nnecessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armorsmith's tools needs a source of power and intense heat\nin order to craft armor or install mods.</p>\n<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits,\nand you must expend raw materials or omni-gel worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market\nvalue greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500-credit increments until you reach the market value of\nthe item. For example, Blood Dragon Armor (market value 101,300 credits) takes 203 days to craft by yourself.</p>\n<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all\nhave proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1000 credits\nworth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool\nproficiency and the proper facilities can craft the Blood Dragon Armor in 68 days, at a total cost of 50,650 credits.</p>\n<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day, or a comfortable\nlifestyle at half the normal cost.</p>\n<h4>Practicing a Profession</h4>\n<p>You can work between missions, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day.\nThis benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide\ngainful employment you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>\n<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn\nenough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>\n<h4>Recuperating</h4>\n<p>You can use downtime between missions to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>\n<p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,\nyou can choose one of the following results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h4>Researching</h4>\n<p>The time between missions is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over\nthe course of the campaign. Research can include poring over the exonet, buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and\ngossip from their lips, or paying for information from certain factions like the Shadow Broker Network.</p>\n<p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will\ntake to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual,\nfile, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation)\ncheck to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid,\nor an Intelligence (Electronics) check to hack into a database. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information\nif it is available.</p>\n<p>For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your\nnormal lifestyle expenses.</p>\n<h4>Training</h4>\n<p>You can spend time between missions training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.</p>\n<p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more\nability checks are required.</p>\n<p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,\nyou gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"88-89\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "body": "To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,\nfuturistic weapons but armor also supplies <strong>shield points</strong>, also called shields (outlined below). Luckily, almost all\ngarments in the mass effect world provide some form of protection. Diaphanous night-gowns can even provide a modicum of\nprotection. Thus, in Mass Effect 5e, almost all operatives are wearing armor and are afforded shield points, unless the player\nor GM explicitly states your character is not wearing armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong>. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type\nknow how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).\nIf you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,\nsaving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack\nproficiency with, you cannot cast spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Points</strong>. <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip> All armor chest pieces\nprovide some amount of shield points. See the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/combat#shields\">Shields</nuxt-link> of the combat section for\nmore information.</p>\n<h3>Mix &amp; Match <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>Unlike D&amp;D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:\n<strong>Head</strong>, <strong>Chest</strong>, <strong>Arms</strong>, and <strong>Legs</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in\nthe Armor / AC table. Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,\nexplained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavier Armor</strong>. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the\nArmor Bonuses and Limitations table shows “Str 12” or “Str 16” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor\nreduces the wearer’s speed by 4m unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p>\n<p>For simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor <em>within</em> placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm\nand a light piece of armor on your left.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Armor / AC\" component=\"armor-ac\"></ai-dialog>\n<ai-dialog title=\"Armor Bonuses and Limitations\" component=\"armor-bonuses-limitations\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<br>\n<h4>Variant: Encumbrance</h4>\n<p>If you are using the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#strength\">Variant: Encumbrance</nuxt-link> rules,\nuse the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Armor Piece Weights\" component=\"armor-piece-weights\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<h3>Armor Sets <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>Most armor you buy in the galaxy has been mass-produced, these are called <strong>armor sets</strong>. A set is not required to be\nmultiple pieces of armor. For example, the Capacitor Helmet is a single piece of head armor. The unique aspect of armor\nsets is that they have benefits and attributes that are pre-installed due to their mass-production. Thus, you cannot\ncustomize armor sets with armor mods and you cannot salvage a beneficial aspect from an armor set.</p>\n<p>Armor sets have an armor type (light, medium, or heavy) which you use for calculating your character's AC.</p>\n<p><strong>Body Armor</strong> is a special type of armor piece that consists of 3 pieces of armor: Chest, Arms, and Legs. Body\narmor is completely integrated (all or none), therefore, you cannot swap out pieces from other sets. I.e., if you're\nwearing the Duelist body armor, you cannot replace the legs from it with the Lockdown Greaves. This rule is, of course, flexible,\nas GMs might allow this type of tinkering in exchange for time, credits, and/or skill checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Set Bonuses</strong> are additional benefits you receive from wearing multiple pieces from the same set, signifying the armors\ncomponent pieces working together for a unified integration. Armor with the same base name is part of a set, e.g. <strong>Colossus</strong> <em>[item]</em>.</p>\n<p>You only receive the benefit once per set and the benefit is end immediately if you fall below the threshold. For example,\na set provides +1 AC for wearing 2 of 4 pieces and +1 AC for wearing 4 of 4 pieces. If you are wearing the head and chest\npieces, you gain +1 AC (in addition to any benefits provided from the set pieces you are wearing). <em>Note: You <strong>do not</strong>\ngain +1 AC for the head and +1 AC for the chest</em>. As soon as you remove either the head piece or the chest piece, you loose\nthe +1 AC.</p>\n<h3>Environmental Protection <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>All armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough\nair and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require\nthat your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the <strong>bubble rule</strong> and claim that all armor suits\ncan cast an energy &quot;bubble&quot; around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.</p>\n<h3>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h3>\n<p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.</p>\n<p><strong>Don</strong>. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Doff</strong>. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Don</th>\n<th>Doff</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Armor</td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium Armor</td>\n<td>5 minutes</td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Armor</td>\n<td>10 minutes</td>\n<td>5 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"62-63\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "body": "Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to\nuse. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the\ndifference between life and death while on a mission.</p>\n<p>The <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/weapons\">Weapons List</nuxt-link> shows the available weapons, their price and weight, the damage\nthey deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.\nA melee weapon is used to attack a target within 2 meters of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at\na distance.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Proficiency <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h3>\n<p>You must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 7 distinct weapon\ntypes and all weapons fall into one of the following types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assault Rifles</strong>. The most common weapons of the military. These are generally medium-range weapons that deal average damage with a high heat capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Pistols</strong>. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-machine Guns (SMGs)</strong>. Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.</li>\n<li><strong>Shotguns</strong>. Close-range, high-damage blasts.</li>\n<li><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong>. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.</li>\n<li><strong>Melee</strong>. Used in close-quarters combat. <em>Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Weapons</strong>. Specialty weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. <em>Heavy Weapons do not have a proficiency requirement</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Weapon Properties</h3>\n<p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons List.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Weapon Properties\" component=\"weapon-properties\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Improvised Weapons</h3>\n<p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes\nany object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.</p>\n<p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to\na club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were\nthat weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,\nit also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 6 meters and a long range of 18 meters. Light improvised thrown weapons have ranges of 10m and 30m, and heavy improvised ranged weapons have ranges of 4m and 12m.</p>\n<h3>Thermal Clips <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>Ranged weapons (guns) use thermal clips to abate heat. All thermal clips are interchangeable between weapons. More information\nabout using thermal clips can be found below.</p>\n<h3>Heavy Weapons <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>Heavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.</p>\n<h4>Targeting</h4>\n<p>Most Heavy Weapons also use the Targeting condition. Targeting means painting the battlefield or keeping a lock on one or more creatures for\na single round of combat. Targeting is considered a free action, as long as you've already drawn the heavy weapon,\ni.e., you can choose to pick-up or equip a weapon as your action, then begin targeting as a free action before your turn ends.\nIf you're already holding the weapon, you might use an ability as your action and then begin targeting.</p>\n<h3>Carrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>You can carry 2 weapons into combat unless a feature or armor mod allows you to carry more. If using the Variant: Encumbrance\nrule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.</p>\n<p>You can holster one weapon you're wielding or draw one weapon you're carrying as a free action. This is true for all weapon types.\nHowever, to holster one weapon <em>then</em> draw a second weapon would require an action.\nBut the GM might allow a Sleight of Hand check to see if you can holster and draw at the cost of your bonus action.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"64-68\"></source-reference></p>\n"

In summary, it's\nunclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have\nspecific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.</p>\n<p>Thus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with\nskills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.\nThe second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantage or Added Benefit</strong>. When the character combines their tool proficiency with a skill, they gain <em>additional insight</em>\nwhich means the operative either gains advantage on the skill check or the can gain an added benefit, decided by the GM.</p>\n<p>For example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency\nwith an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet) or they might gain\nan added benefit, such as finding some additional information or key codes.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Skill</strong>. Operatives proficient in a tool have a unique activity they can perform during a sort or long rest.\nFor example, a character proficient with Armorsmith's Workbench can craft armor or attempt to remove mods.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Activities</strong>. Each tool also has sample activity DCs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list. GMs can adjust\nDCs or create new activities as they see fit.

    "body": "Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator.\nThe fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics,\nceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the\nreuse of salvaged equipment.</p>\n<p>Most omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator\ndesigns.  However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general\npopulation's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs\nthat have been scrubbed from the exonet.</p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Some omni-tool programs require an operative to integrate the module into the tool's microframe before the benefits can\nbe used. This process is called Installation, and certain programs have a prerequisite for it.</p>\n<p>Installation requires an operative to spend a short rest focused on only installing and debugging the program. If the short\nrest is interrupted, the installation attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the operative gains the\nbenefits of the program.</p>\n<p>A program can be installed to only one omni-tool at a time. Almost all programs come with a powerful DRM and security\nsystem that prevents the program being installed on multiple omni-tools or replicated. Interestingly,\nbefore the humans were granted an embassy on the Citadel in 2165, the concept of digital rights management was foreign to\nthe other races of the galaxy. But since 2165, omni-tool programs have been locked down. Attempting to hack the DRM\ngenerally has a terrible result.</p>\n<p>An omni-tool can only have three programs activated at once. Any attempt to install to a fourth program fails; the operative\nmust first uninstall the program from their tool (this also takes a short rest). Once uninstalled, the program can be\ntraded and installed on a separated tool. Additionally, omni-tools can't have more than one copy of a program installed.</p>\n<h3>Single-Use Programs</h3>\n<p>Manufacturers and militaries quickly realized it was much easier, cheaper, faster, and (usually) safer to send bits of\ndata rather than physical products, and let fabricators generate the devices on site using generic materials, like omni-gel.\nAfter the advent of omni-tools, a number of industries used this method to ship their products. However, to avoid\nunauthorized replication, the programs would scrub themselves once the job was complete.</p>\n<p>Omni-tool programs that don't require installation are single-use and cost a number of omni-gel to create the final product.\nOnce used, the program is completely wiped. As with installed programs, attempts to recreate these pieces of code can be\ncostly, even deadly.</p>\n<h3>Unstable Programs</h3>\n<p>Unstable Programs are entirely experimental, therefore the number of times you can run the program varies widely. In some\ncases, unstable programs are single-use programs that are hacked for multiple uses. A GM can create an Unstable Program\nfrom a Single-Use program by assigning a die roll (d4, d6, etc) to the number of times the program can be used.</p>\n<p><v-btn to=\"/phb/programs\" color=\"primary\">Omni-tool programs</v-btn></p>\n"

You dine\nat the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have workers attending to your every need.\nYou receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful and spend evenings in the company of politicians,\ncommunity leaders, and other elite persons. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The\nwealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>\n<h3>Self Sufficiency</h3>\n<p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures on an advanced planet\nin a city or town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford - paying for food and lodging, paying\nskilled workers to mend your armor or service your weapons, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend\ntheir time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p>\n<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your\ntime between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in\nSurvival the skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"72-73\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "title": "Basic Information",

    "body": "All vehicles share some of the same basic features.</p>\n<h3>Armor Class</h3>\n<p>AC for vehicles works exactly the same as in the <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/equipment#armor\">basic 5e rules</nuxt-link>.</p>\n<h3>Hull Points (hit points)</h3>\n<p>This represents how much damage a vehicle or starship can take before it is destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Shield Points</h3>\n<p>Shields for vehicles and starships work generally the same as in the main <nuxt-link to=\"/phb/combat#shields\"/>ME5e rules</nuxt-link>,\nwith a notable exception: Vehicle shields can only be regenerated in combat when players attempt the\nRestore action (explained later in this section).</p>\n<h3>Speed</h3>\n<p>For vehicles, speed is relative to other vehicles and is represented as a static number not as meters. For\nthe purposes of combat, it represents the number of playmat spaces the vehicle can move on its turn when moving\nat a normal pace.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>Range represents how far the vehicle can travel in one 24 period. For starships, range is used in conjunction with\nthe Galaxy Map. Each line indicates the travel time between star systems, which you subtract from the starships range.\nTravel to planets within a star systems costs 1 range. You can read more about range for starships in the\n<nuxt-link to=\"/phb/vehicles#travelling-the-galaxy\">Traveling the Galaxy section</nuxt-link></p>\n<h3>Minimum Crew</h3>\n<p>The number of crew required for the vehicle to operate. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be possible to\noperate a vehicle with less than the minimum required number of crew. Rolls made to operate vehicles in these conditions\nwill most likely be made at disadvantage, again at the GM’s discretion.</p>\n<h3>Crew Capacity</h3>\n<p>The total number of sentient organisms that a ship can accommodate. This is a combination of active crew and any passengers.\nIn some cases, this number can be expanded by using cargo capacity, below.</p>\n<h3>Cargo Capacity</h3>\n<p>How much “stuff” a vehicle can hold. This is measured in Megagrams (also known as a “tonne” or “metric ton”).</p>\n<p><strong>1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 2,204 lbs.</strong></p>\n<p>This will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg (500 kg). When calculating cargo\ncapacity, we suggest using this as a guideline to estimate cargo capacity rather than getting bogged down in specific\ncalculations. For points of reference, a small hatchback car weighs just over 1 Mg while the largest tanker ships\nin the world have a capacity of over 200,000 Mg.</p>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<p><strong>Systems</strong> refer to a number of semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of a vehicle. These are\nthings like navigation, communications, weapons array, etc. These are used to simulate the cooperative effort involved\nin operating larger, complex vessels, and player characters will often be called upon to make skill-based rolls to\noperate these individual systems. Generally speaking, small vehicles, especially those with only a single crew member,\nwill not have designated systems.</p>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong>, in many cases, will refer to a specific system or systems on a vehicle. Vehicle-mounted weapons will\ntypically have a multiplier after their damage roll to represent how powerful they are. For example, a cruiser’s mass\naccelerator cannon has a damage roll of 2d6[x100] and an M35 Mako’s coaxial machine-gun has a damage roll of 2d6[x10].\nIn these situations, you roll and add damage dice and any bonuses as usual. After you have determined your result,\nmultiply the total by the amount indicated. In our example, if both weapons roll a <strong>7</strong> for their damage, the cruiser\ndeals <strong>700</strong> damage and the Mako deals <strong>70</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>Most transports use the standard size categories: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. However,\nstarships can become truly colossal and have 4 additional categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Frigates</strong> are light transport vehicles, usually used for exploration, transportation of small squads, privately\nfunded excursions, or stealth transport. The Normandy is an example of a frigate. Frigates can land on planets and\ntypically host a crew of 5-20.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruisers</strong> are middleweight ships that can either transport large amounts of supplies from place to place or focus on\nfirepower. Military cruisers tend to be the front-line of the battle and have powerful weapons, shields, and armor.\nCruisers typically have crews of 20 - 100 and are able to land on planets.</p>\n<p><strong>Carriers</strong>, also called <em>freighters</em>,\nare large ships meant to carry transports (starfighters and dropships). Carriers are primarily military\nin nature though some venture capitalists have used carriers for mining operations and colonizing efforts. Carriers are\ntypically weak in combat, being slow and lacking much firepower or shielding. Instead, carriers utilize their transports\nfor offense and defense. Carriers are built in space and are too large to land on planets (purposefully). Instead, most\ncarriers use drop ships for planetary exploration. Carriers can support crews in the hundreds.</p>\n<p><strong>Dreadnoughts</strong> are the largest class of ship, generally a kilometer or more long with incredible firepower that’s\nharnessed in the main cannon which is able to decimate entire cities, squads of enemy fighters, and other dreadnoughts. Dreadnoughts\nare meant for extended life in space, usually hosting a crew in the thousands and a self-sustaining ecosystem of shops,\nleisure activities, police force, politics, etc. Think of dreadnaughts as a small town floating through space. The arks\nof Andromeda were dreadnoughts as are the Liveships that the quarian race inhabits. The ships are so costly to make\nthat the total number of dreadnoughts in the Milky Way is less than 200 with most races having only one or none. It’s\nimpossible to land Dreadnoughts on planets safely.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>The costs listed for vehicles represent their market value. Some vehicles, instead, are <strong>military</strong> meaning the vehicles\ncannot be purchased on the open market. Instead, characters will need inside connects, the black market, or luck\nto acquire these vehicles.</p>\n<h3>CR</h3>\n<p>Transports have a CR between 0 and 30, which is based on its hp, ac, and damage. Starships have a <strong>+</strong> symbol after\ntheir CR, which indicates that this CR is a relative representation based on other starships. It is unlikely that operatives\nwill destroy a starship with traditional weapons. Instead, they'll likely have to use other vehicles. For example,\na starship with a CR of <strong>12+</strong> has the same XP reward as a level CR creature when the operatives destroy it\nusing other vehicles. If operatives did manage to destroy the vehicle using traditional means, we recommend\nproviding XP equal to the standard amount multiplied by 10. For example, a cr 12 creature provides 8,400 XP. If players\ndestroyed this with traditional means, the GM can reward 84,000 XP.</p>\n"

    "body": "<galaxy-map :height=\"$vuetify.breakpoint.smAndDown ? '80vw' : '50vw'\n<h3>The Milky Way</h3>\n<p>The Milky Way comprises a number of <strong>Clusters</strong> (represented by the yellow, target icons <v-icon>filter_center_focus</v-icon> on the map).\nEach Cluster is composed of <strong>Systems</strong>, and, in turn, each System contains a group of planetary objects (generally a\nstar and any number of planets and their moons, planetoids, asteroids, comets and other celestial bodies).</p>\n<p>For example, Earth is a planet in the Sol System, which is the only system in the Local Cluster. Tuchanka (the homeworld\nof the Krogan) is part of the Aralakh System, which is one of 3 systems in the Krogan DMZ cluster.</p>\n<p><strong>Note on names</strong>: You may wonder why the names aren’t more “alien”. Our best guess is that the names are either part\nof a human-centered database (in which names were provided to the entries by humans), or that the names have been\ntranslated into similar human-cultured counterparts. For example, the Athena Nebula is home of the Asari, a race of\nandrogynous beings that associate themselves to a female gender. Thus the nebula’s name (in Asari) might be a cultural\nfigure, turn-of-phase, or mystical entity that is best represented as Athena in human culture.</p>\n<h3>Traveling between clusters, systems, and planets</h3>\n<br>\n<h4>Space Transports</h4>\n<p>There four types of transports in the game: land, water, air, and space. To leave a planet or move between planets in a\nsystem requires a space transport. For simplicity's sake, travel within a system (from any celestial body to\nanother) takes less than 24 hours. Using the Sol system as an example, a party could leave Earth and arrive at Io,\nEuropa, Pluto, or Sol’s Mass Relay within 24 hours. The GM can adjust this time as they see fit. A rickety ship\nmight move more slowly and require many stops at moons and planets along the way. A very fast ship might make the\njourney from Earth to Pluto within a few hours.</p>\n<h4>Leaving a planet</h4>\n<p>The time it takes to leave a planet varies widely based on how regulated space traffic is on that planet. On urban worlds\nlike Thessia or the Citadel, it can take as long as 2-4 hours to orbit and dock. On uninhabited worlds, your ship can\nland and leave as quickly as the pilot is capable. This can take as little as a few minutes. Finding a safe place to\nland might take a little longer.</p>\n<h4>Starships</h4>\n<p>To travel from system to system, or cluster to cluster, your party will need to use a starship. Every\nstarship has a <strong>range</strong> attribute which represents the number of system and cluster jumps it can make in a 24\nhour period. Traveling between systems in a cluster or jumping from one cluster to another takes 1 range.</p>\n<p>Traveling between systems is the same as traveling between planets. You can move to any other system within a cluster\nand it costs 1 range. A starship with 3 range that starts on Tuchanka can leave the planet an arrive in\nNith (another system in the Krogan DMZ cluster) within 24 hours. The same starship (with a range of 3) could also leave\nTurchanka, fly to the Nith system, then to the Dranek system (also in the Krogan DMZ cluster), and back to the\nAralakh system within a 24 hour period. If the ship was making stops on planets in each system, it would likely take\nlonger as the ship enters and leaves orbit.</p>\n<p>Traveling between clusters requires a <strong>Mass Relay</strong>. Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered throughout the\nMilky Way, forming an enormous network that allows interstellar travel. There is only one Mass Relay per cluster, located\nin a single system which is marked with a * on the map. To travel from cluster to cluster, you must first travel to\nthe system that contains the mass effect relay. Then you can jump to another cluster.</p>\n<p>Mass Relays are connected as a network, but travel between relays might require additional jumps. I.e., unlike travel\nbetween planets and systems, you can only move between clusters following the lines on the map.</p>\n<v-alert type=\"info\" :value=\"true\">\n<p><strong>EXAMPLE TRAVEL</strong></p>\n<p>The party has been searching for a Prothean device in the Carbonaceous Asteroid (<em>Phoenix system, Argos Rho cluster</em>).\nTo collect their reward, they must return the device to a fence on the Citadel.</p>\n<p>In this example, the party has requisitioned a starship with a range of 2. It takes 1 range to move from the\nPhoenix system to the Hydra system which contains the Mass Relay for the Argos Rho cluster. Then it requires 2 Mass\nRelay jumps (Argos Rho &gt; Horse Head Nebula &gt; Serpent Nebula), arriving in the Widow system where the Citadel is located.\nFor our group, this would take as little as 24 but no more than 48 hours to complete the journey.</p>\n</v-alert>\n"

Roll a die based on how rich the planet is, and gain that many\nunits of the element.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-content\">\n<h3>Elements</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rarity</th>\n<th>Elements</th>\n<th>Credits / Unit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td>Aluminium, Beryllium, Copper, Graphite, Iron, Magnesium, Silicon</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uncommon</td>\n<td>Cadmium, Fluorite, Iridium, Lithium, Nickel, Uranium</td>\n<td>250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>Palladium, Platinum, Titanium, Vanadium</td>\n<td>500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very Rare</td>\n<td>Element Zero</td>\n<td>1500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h3>Mining Results</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Richness</th>\n<th>Result Dice</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Scarce</td>\n<td>d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poor</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abundant</td>\n<td>d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rich</td>\n<td>d12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Variant: Fuel</h3>\n<p>Fuel in Mass Effect 5e is an abstract concept. Most ships can mine and create fuel using on-board fabricators as it travels\nthe Galaxy. Fuel is represented by the <strong>range</strong> of the ship (how far it can travel in 24 hours). If you would like to keep track\nof fuel, the GM can use the following Variant: Fuel rules.</p>\n<p>Your &quot;tank&quot; capacity is equal to your ship's range multiplied by 3. Each time you expend 1 range, you also expend 1 charge from your\ntank. You can either spend a long rest on an asteroid or planet mining fuel or you can refuel at a spaceport. To mine\nfuel use the Variant: Mining rules above. On a success, roll a d8 and regain that many charges.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can pay to refuel at a spaceport. The average rate is 1,000 credits per charge in your tank, but this\nmight increase or decrease based on the port.</p>\n<p><v-btn to=\"/phb/vehicles\" color=\"primary\">Vehicle List</v-btn></p>\n"

    "id": "creating_new vehicles",
    "body": "The Vehicle List above provides a short list of vehicle examples for you to use in your campaign. However, it is\nencouraged that you and/or your GM create vehicles of their own to use in your campaign. Use the following guidelines\nwhen creating your vehicle.</p>\n<h3>Create a concept</h3>\n<p>First, you'll want to create a concept for your vehicle. What is its main purpose (defense, offense, transport, smuggling, etc)?\nWhat race(s) are associated with the vehicle? Is it unique or mass produced? What does it look like? What size is it?</p>\n<p>If you're looking for inspiration, check out <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/euderion/gallery/40849119/MASS-EFFECT\" target=\"_blank\">Euderion's vehicle creations on DeviantArt</a>.</p>\n<h3>Name</h3>\n<p>Next, you'll need a good name for your vehicle. Mass produced vehicles typically have some sort of manufacturing number\ncombined with a codename or nickname. If your vehicle is a unique creation, it might have a symbolic name.</p>\n<h3>Vehicle Type</h3>\n<p>The vehicle type should be either <strong>transport</strong> or <strong>starship</strong>. If you've selected transport, designate which\ntransport type it is: <strong>land</strong>, <strong>sea</strong>, <strong>air</strong>, or <strong>space</strong>. Some transports can have multiple types.</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>If you're creating a transport, choose the size from standard sizes: Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan. For starships,\nchoose one of Frigate, Cruiser, Carrier, or Dreadnought.</p>\n<h3>Speed</h3>\n<p>A vehicles speed is somewhat abstract. Mechanically, it represents the number of playmat spaces it can move in one turn.\nThis assumes the vehicle is moving an average pace and slow enough to turn and maneuver. Speed should range from 1 to 15.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>For transports, range is the number of kilometers the vehicle can travel within 24 hours. This calculation should also\ntake its battery or fuel capacity into account.</p>\n<p>For starships, the range is calculated as ftlu (faster than light units). Essentially how many Mass Effect Relay jumps\nor system to system travel it can complete in 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Cargo</h3>\n<p>How many tonnes can the ship carry? Try thinking about how many mid-size cars can fit into the vehicle or the vehicle tow,\nthis is its Cargo capacity.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>What is the market rate of the vehicle? It might be that the vehicle is military and not sold on the open market.</p>\n<h3>AC</h3>\n<p>How durable is your vehicle's armor? Or how difficult is it to hit? ACs for vehicles generally range from 10 - 25.</p>\n<h3>HP &amp; SP</h3>\n<p>Use the following table to find the average hull points and shield points. You should adjust the average based on the\nconcept of your vehicle. Was it made for defense? Add more HP. Does it has a state-of-the-art drive, add more SP.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-content\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>HP</th>\n<th>SP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Transport</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigate</td>\n<td>1200</td>\n<td>250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cruiser</td>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier</td>\n<td>3500</td>\n<td>750</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dreadnought</td>\n<td>6000</td>\n<td>1500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<p>Next, you'll want to decide how many systems your vehicle has. You can either make combined systems (for smaller vehicles)\nor have individual systems (for large starships). A system might be so advanced that it requires multiple crew member to\nmaintain.</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<h4>Minimum</h4>\n<p>To find the minimum crew, add the number of crew needed for each of the systems.</p>\n<h4>Maximum</h4>\n<p>The maximum crew is generally based on the size of the vehicle</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-content\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Max Crew</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>2-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hugh</td>\n<td>6-8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>10-20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigate</td>\n<td>20-30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cruiser</td>\n<td>30-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier</td>\n<td>100-1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dreadnought</td>\n<td>1000+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>Decide what weapons are equipped on the vehicle. For transports, damage rolls are multiplied by 10 and by 100 for\nstarships. It's also ok for the vehicle to have no weapons.</p>\n<h3>CR</h3>\n<p>To calculate the CR, you'll need access to the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table in the Dungeon Master's\nGuide, pg. 274.</p>\n<h4>Offensive CR</h4>\n<p>First, find the offensive CR by calculating the average of all the damaging attacks. If this is a starship, additionally\ndivide the average by 10. Then find the CR associated with that damage on the Monster Stats table.</p>\n<h4>Defensive CR</h4>\n<p>Next, find the defensive CR by adding the hull point and shield points together. If this is a starship, additionally,\ndivide the sum by 10. Then find the CR associated with that hit point value on the Monster Stats table. If the AC\nis greater than the AC on the Monster Stats table, increase the defensive CR by 1 for every 2 points above the target AC.</p>\n<h4>Final CR</h4>\n<p>The final CR is the average of the offensive and defensive CR, rounded up. If this is for a starship, notate a <strong>+</strong> symbol\nbeside the CR.</p>\n<h4>Transport example:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AC: 20</li>\n<li>HP: 250</li>\n<li>SP: 0</li>\n<li>Attacks: 35 &amp; 55</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Offensive CR = (35 + 55) / 2 = 45</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 7</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive CR = 250 + 0 = 250</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 12. However, the target AC for CR 12 is only 17. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 13 (+1 because the AC is 20).</p>\n<p><strong>Final CR = (13 + 7) / 2 = 10</strong></p>\n<h4>Starship example:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AC: 25</li>\n<li>HP: 2500</li>\n<li>SP: 600</li>\n<li>Attack: 1100 &amp; 900</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Offensive CR = ((1100 + 900) / 2) / 10 = 100</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 16</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive CR = (2500 + 600) / 10 = 310</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 16. However, the target AC for CR 16 is only 18. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 19 (+3 because the AC is 25).</p>\n<p><strong>Final CR = (16 + 19) / 2 = 17.5 = 18+</strong></p>\n<h3>Additional Details</h3>\n<p>Finally, write a short description about your vehicle and notate if it has any special abilities, additional systems,\nor available system slots.</p>\n<h3>Share with Us!</h3>\n<p>If you'd like to have your creation added, feel free to share it with us!

    "title": "The Order of Combat",
    "id": "the_order of combat",
    "body": "A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of bullets, energy weapons, ducking behind cover,\nslinging biotic and tech spells. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round\nrepresents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of\nturns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a\nturn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>\n<h3>Combat Step by Step</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine surprise</strong>. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish positions</strong>. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the operatives' marching\norder or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries ar - -how far away and in what direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Roll initiative</strong>. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.</li>\n<li><strong>Take turns</strong>. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>\n<li><strong>Begin the next round</strong>. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<h3>Surprise</h3>\n<p>A team of operatives sneaks up on a patrolling cerberus squad, springing from behind cargo crates to attack them. A varren\nslinks in the shadows, unnoticed by the operatives until the varren attacks one of them. In these situations, one side of\nthe battle gains surprise over the other.</p>\n<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other.\nOtherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of\neach creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p>\n<p>If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction\nuntil that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</p>\n<h3>Initiative</h3>\n<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to\ndetermine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each\nmember of the group acts at the same time.</p>\n<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This\nis the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same\nfrom round to round.</p>\n<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among\ntheir tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally,\nthe GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>\n<h3>Your Turn</h3>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take\nyour action first. Your speed - sometimes called your walking speed - is noted on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the &quot;Actions in Combat&quot; section below. Many class features and\nother abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Movement and Position&quot; section gives the rules for your move.</p>\n<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your\nturn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in &quot;Actions in Combat.&quot;</p>\n<h4>Bonus Actions</h4>\n<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.\nThe Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an infiltrator to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only\nwhen a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You\notherwise don't have a bonus action to take.</p>\n<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than\none available.</p>\n<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything\nthat deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>\n<h4>Other Activity on Your Turn</h4>\n<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>\n<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>\n<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.\nFor example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part\nof the same action you use to attack.</p>\n<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some items and other special objects always\nrequire an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an\nunusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a\npush a large crate into a covering position.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an\ninstant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack,\ndescribed later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p>\n<p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts\nanother creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"90-91\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "type": "rule",
    "subType": "rules",
    "qualifiers": [],
    "title": "Movement & Position",
    "id": "movement_& position",
    "body": "In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your\nturn, following the rules here.</p>\n<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking,\nor they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your\nspeed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Up Your Move</h3>\n<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you\nhave a speed of 10 meters, you can move 4 meters, take your action, and then move 6 meters.</p>\n<h4>Moving between Attacks</h4>\n<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving\nbetween those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed\nof 10 meters could move 4 meters, make an attack, move 4 meters, and then attack again.</p>\n<h4>Using Different Speeds</h4>\n<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your\nspeeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result\ndetermines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a speed of 10 and a flying speed of 20 because you're wearing a jetpack, you could fly 10 meters,\nthen walk 4 meters, and then leap into the air to fly 6 meters more.</p>\n<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous\nstaircases - the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Every meter of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra meter. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space\ncount as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Low furniture, crates, trash cans, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult\nterrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>Being Prone</h3>\n<p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves\ndown. In the game, they are prone. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes\nmore effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 meters, you must\nspend 5 meters of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>\n<p>To move while prone, you must crawl. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra meter. Crawling 1 meter in difficult\nterrain, therefore, costs 3 meters of movement.</p>\n<h3>Interacting with Objects</h3>\n<p>Around You Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>draw <em>or</em> sheathe a sword</li>\n<li>open or close a door</li>\n<li>withdraw a medi-gel from your armor</li>\n<li>pick up a dropped weapon</li>\n<li>take a datapad from a table</li>\n<li>remove your helmet</li>\n<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>\n<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>\n<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>\n<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>\n<li>extinguish a small flame</li>\n<li>put your ear to a door</li>\n<li>kick a small stone</li>\n<li>tap the floor with your weapon</li>\n<li>hand an item to another character</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Moving Around Other Creatures</h3>\n<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if\nthe creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.</p>\n<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.</p>\n<p>If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later.</p>\n<h3>Flying Movement</h3>\n<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature\nis knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless\nit has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by biotics, such as by the fly spell.</p>\n<h3>Creature Size</h3>\n<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a\nparticular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Size Category\" component=\"size-category\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<br>\n<h4>Space</h4>\n<p>A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical\ndimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 2 meters wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a\nMedium asari stands in a 2‐meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the asari lets them.</p>\n<p>A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number\nof creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 2-meter\nradius around another one.</p>\n<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around\na Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround\na Gargantuan one.</p>\n<h4>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h4>\n<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature\ncan squeeze through a passage that's only 2 meters wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra\nmeter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls\nagainst the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"91-92\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "subType": "rules",
    "qualifiers": [],
    "title": "Actions in Combat",
    "id": "actions_in combat",
    "body": "When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your\nclass or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p>\n<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and\nwhat kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<h3>Attack</h3>\n<p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling\nwith your fists.</p>\n<p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the &quot;Making an Attack&quot; section for the rules that govern attacks.</p>\n<p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p>\n<h3>Cast a Spell</h3>\n<p>Spellcasters such as engineers and adepts have access to biotics or tech powers and can use them to great effect in combat.\nEach spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours\nto cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,\nso a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p>\n<h3>Dash</h3>\n<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after\napplying any modifiers. With a speed of 10 meters, for example, you can move up to 20 meters on your turn if you dash.</p>\n<p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 10 meters\nis reduced to 6 meters, for instance, you can move up to 12 meters this turn if you dash.</p>\n<h3>Disengage <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h3>\n<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,\nthe Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.</p>\n<h3>Dodge <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h4></h3>\n<p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack\nroll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.\nYou lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.</p>\n<p>The Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.</p>\n<h3>Help</h3>\n<p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you\naid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes\nthe check before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 2 meters of you. You feint, distract the\ntarget, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before\nyour next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>\n<h3>Hide <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h4></h3>\n<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for\n<nuxt-link to=\"/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#dexterity\">hiding</nuxt-link>.</p>\n<p>If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &quot;Unseen Attackers and Targets&quot; section later.</p>\n<p>Hiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.</p>\n<h3>Ready</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take\nthe Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in\nresponse to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &quot;If the Blue Suns grunt steps\non the conveyor belt, I'll push the button that starts it,&quot; and &quot;If the rachni steps next to me, I move away.&quot;</p>\n<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember\nthat you can take only one reaction per round.</p>\n<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger\noccurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires\nconcentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are\nconcentrating on the singularity spell and ready lance, your singularity spell end, and if you take damage before you\nrelease lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>\n<h3>Reload <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>All guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.\nWhen you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you're currently\nholding, returning the weapon's heat to its maximum value.</p>\n<h4>Variant: Rapid Reload</h4>\n<p>At the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.\nMake a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you're currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.\nOn a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,\nyour weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.</p>\n<p><em>Why is this a variant rule?</em> Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,\nthis variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of\npotential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It's up to the GM and players to decide if this rule\nis right for their group.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,\nthe GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<h3>Use an Object</h3>\n<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.\nWhen an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.\nThis action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"91-92\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "title": "Making an Attack",
    "id": "making_an attack",
    "body": "Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an\nattack has a simple structure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage\nagainst the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an\nattack roll, you're making an attack.</p>\n<h3>Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a\nd20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class\n(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its\nstat block.</p>\n<h4>Modifiers to the Roll</h4>\n<p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's\nproficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p>\n<p>_<strong>Ability Modifier</strong>. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for\na ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse, thrown, or recoil property break this rule. Some spells\nalso require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong>. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you\nhave proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>\n<h4>Rolling 1 or 20</h4>\n<p>Sometimes lady luck blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p>\n<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a\ncritical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p>\n<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.</p>\n<h3>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h3>\n<p>Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting tactical cloak, or lurking in darkness.</p>\n<p>When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing\nthe target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you\ntargeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the\ntarget's location correctly.</p>\n<p>When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - -both unseen and\nunheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a gun or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\nshoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p>\n<p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.</p>\n<p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a gun, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack\na target beyond the long range.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4>\n<p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell,\nor some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature who can\nsee you and who isn't incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Melee Attacks</h3>\n<p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a\nhandheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an omni-tool. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes\nwith its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>\n<p>Most creatures have a 2-meter reach and can thus attack targets within 2 meters of them when making a melee attack. Certain\ncreatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 2 meters, as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar\nforceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your\nStrength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h4>Gun strikes <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h4>\n<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use your ranged weapon, hitting a target with the butt of\nthe gun. On a hit, a gun strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with\ngun strikes if you are proficient with the type of gun.</p>\n<h4>Opportunity Attacks</h4>\n<p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a\nstrike is called an opportunity attack.</p>\n<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the\nopportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs\nright before the creature leaves your reach.</p>\n<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity\nattack when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke\nan opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if an adept lifts you off the ground with Pull.</p>\n<h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>\n<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a\nbonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your\nability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>\n<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>\n<h3>Contests in Combat</h3>\n<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This\nsection includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The\nGM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p>\n<h4>Grappling</h4>\n<p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.\nIf you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least\none free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics)\ncheck contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).\nIf you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled. The condition specifies the things that end it,\nand you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>\n<p><strong>Escaping a Grapple</strong>. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics)\nor Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature</strong>. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is\nhalved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>\n<h4>Shoving a Creature</h4>\n<p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it\naway from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll,\nyou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check\n(the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 2 meters\naway from you.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"94-96\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "id": "cover",
    "body": "Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm.\nA target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p>\n<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of\ncover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and\na tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>\n<h3>Half Cover</h3>\n<p>A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks\nat least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature,\nwhether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p>\n<h3>Three-quarters Cover</h3>\n<p>A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover\nif about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a doorway, a large crate, or a thick tree trunk.</p>\n<h3>Total Cover</h3>\n<p>A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a\ntarget by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>\n<h3>Variant: Additional Cover Rules <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>Size matters. If the target is one size larger than the creature providing cover, the target has no cover. If the target\nis one size smaller than the creature providing cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>\n<h4>High Ground</h4>\n<p>Flying enemies or creatures on high ground are able to shoot over cover depending on the type of cover provided</p>\n<h4>Friendly Fire</h4>\n<p>Don't hit your friends! If the creature providing cover is friendly and the attacking creature misses, the attack has a\n50% chance to hit the friendly target. Roll a die and if the result is odd the attack hits, even the attack misses both\ncreatures. Or you can use the friendly creature's AC to decide if the attack hits or misses.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"96\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "title": "Damage and Healing",
    "id": "damage_and healing",
    "body": "Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword,\na well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from an incinerate spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the\nhardiest of creatures.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more\nhit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>\n<p>A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum\ndown to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p>\n<p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on\na creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Points</strong>. Creatures wearing armor also benefit from <strong>shield points</strong> described below.</p>\n<h3>Damage Rolls</h3>\n<p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any\nmodifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\nWith a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p>\n<p>When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier - the same modifier used for the attack roll - to the damage.\nA spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p>\n<p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.\nFor example, when an adept casts vortex or an engineer casts flamethrower, the spell's damage is rolled once for all\ncreatures caught in the blast.</p>\n<h4>Critical Hits</h4>\n<p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the\nattack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can\nroll all the damage dice at once.</p>\n<p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a monomolecular blade, roll 2d10 for the damage, rather than 1d10, and then\nadd your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the infiltrator's Sneak Attack feature,\nyou roll those dice twice as well.</p>\n<h4>Damage Types <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h4>\n<p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules\nof their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p>\n<p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p>\n<p><ai-dialog title=\"Damage Types\" component=\"damage-types\"></ai-dialog></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h3>\n<p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>\n<p>If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or\nan object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>\n<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance\nto bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tech aura\nthat reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>\n<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example,\nif a creature has resistance to force damage as well as resistance to biotic damage, the damage of a biotic force damage\nis reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>\n<h3>Healing</h3>\n<p>Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through experimental cloning. Rest can\nrestore a creature's hit points, and medical methods such as a medi-gel or first aid spell can remove damage in an instant.</p>\n<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit\npoints can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, an\nengineer grants a sentinel 8 hit points of healing. If the sentinel has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum\nof 20, the sentinel regains 6 hit points from the engineer, not 8.</p>\n<p>A creature that has died can't regain hit points.</p>\n<h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>\n<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>\n<h4>Instant Death</h4>\n<p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die\nif the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>\n<p>For example, a solider with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack,\nshe is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the soldier dies.</p>\n<h4>Falling Unconscious</h4>\n<p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you\nregain any hit points.</p>\n<h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to\ndetermine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any\nability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of\nsucceeding on a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself.\nOn your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't\nneed to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when\nyou regain any hit points or become stable.</p>\n<p>Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20\non the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If\nthe damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum,\nyou suffer instant death.</p>\n<h4>Stabilizing a Creature</h4>\n<p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be\nstabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>\n<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a\nsuccessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>\n<p>A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.\nThe creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable\ncreature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>\n<h4>Monsters and Death</h4>\n<p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make\ndeath saving throws.</p>\n<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and\nfollow the same rules as player characters.</p>\n<h3>Knocking a Creature Out</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature\nto 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the\ninstant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p>\n<h3>Temporary Hit Points</h3>\n<p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points;\nthey are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>\n<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage\ncarries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the\ntemporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>\n<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character\ncan, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>\n<p>Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive\nmore of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a drug grants you\n12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>\n<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can\nstill absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p>\n<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"96-98\"></source-reference></p>\n"

Whether on\na starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same. Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect\nfields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This\naffords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles but still allows the user to sit down without knocking\naway their chair. The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins,\nor radiation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Shield Points</h3>\n<p>Shield points are a special type of regenerating hit points that protect your from fast-moving projectiles and provide\nadvantage in certain situations against some tech and biotic powers.</p>\n<h3>Shield devices</h3>\n<p>All armor chest pieces come standard with <em>5 shield points</em> and a <em>regen of 5</em>. However, more advanced mods and armor\nsets can provide additional shields. Additionally, personal shield generators are available which can provide shields\nwithout the operative equipping armor.</p>\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n<p>If you have at least 1 shield point when you take damage, the is applied it is subtracted from your shield points first,\nthen from your hit points.

You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each\nof your turns. If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.</p>\n<v-alert :value=\"true\" type=\"info\">\n<p><strong>SHIELD REGENERATION EXAMPLE</strong></p>\nTodd is playing human vanguard name Todd who has invested heavily in his armor's shields, giving him 20 shield points\nwith a regen of 10.

On his turn, Todd thinks better of his actions and decides to take the Dodge action, ducking behind a crate.\n<p>Some marauders lose sight of Todd, others attempt to hit him again, but are unsuccessful. At the start of Todd's turn,\nhe has taken no damage since the end of his last turn and his shields begin to regenerate, immediately gaining 10 shield points.\nTodd now has 14 shield points total. Todd takes his turn as he normally would.</p>\n<p>An adept spots Todd and hits him with a Warp spell. This bypasses Todd's shields and deals 13 necrotic damage. But it\ndoes not end his shield regeneration. If this damage had been from an Assault Rifle or an Incinerate spell, Todd's shield\nregeneration would have ended.</p>\n<p>On Todd's next turn, he gains another 10 shield points, putting him back to his maximum capacity of 20 and the regeneration\nends.\n</v-alert></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Lightning Damage</h3>\n<p>All shields are vulnerable to lightning damage. In the event that a lighting attack removes all shield points, the\nfollowing steps outline how to divvy up the damage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Double the lightning damage done to the target.</li>\n<li>Subtract the shield points from the total damage.</li>\n<li>Reduce the remaining damage by half</li>\n<li>Apply the new amount to the target's hit points.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Higher-end omni-tools are\nequipped by Engineers, Sentinels, and Infiltrators to make use of their tech talents and powers.

    "body": "<hKnown Spells</h3>\n<p>Biotics rely on physical mnemonics and a biotic implant to harness the power of mass effect fields. Learning the mnemonics\ntakes years of practice. Once mastered, biotic users can learn new varieties of controlling the fields. As biotic characters\nprogress in levels, they learn knew varieties of biotic spells or can augment the power or utility of an existing one.\nIn any case, once a biotic user learns a spell, it is always at their disposal.</p>\n<h3>Prepared Spells</h3>\n<p>Tech powers utilize technological assistance and micro-fabricators that are built into the operative's omni-tool.\nUnlike biotic users, tech users can program new spells and powers into their omni-tool\nlike loading software onto a computer. However, the mental load required to access these powers in the heat of combat\ntakes a superior intellect. More programs cause more confusion, and without the mental training and years of practice,\ntech users are limited in the number of spells they can bring into combat. This limit increases as tech users level, detailed\nin the class's description.</p>\n<h3>Advancing Spells <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>The class progression tables indicate when a class learns a new spell. In Mass Effect 5e, characters can choose\nto augment a spell they've already learned rather than learning a new one. You may only have one advancement of a spell at a time.</p>\n"

    "title": "Spell Slots",
    "id": "spell_slots",
    "body": "Regardless of how many biotic spells knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting.\nManipulating the gravitational forces into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells\nare even more so. Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level\na character can use at each character level.</p>\n<p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively &quot;filling&quot; a slot\nwith the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a\nspell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level spell fits only in a 4th-level slot.\nSo when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level spell, he or she spends one 1st-level slot.</p>\n<p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.</p>\n<h3>Casting at a Higher Level</h3>\n<p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level\nfor that casting. For instance, if an operative casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p>\n<p>Some spells, such as lance and first ait, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a\nspell's description.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>In Mass Effect 5e, certain classes can use tech points to cast spells. Tech points represent the internal power of\nthe operative's omni-tool. As the operative levels, the gain more tech points, representing the time they spend\nmodifying their omni-tool and optimizing subroutines.</p>\n<p>When a character casts a spell with tech points, he or she expends, at minimum, one tech point per spell's level:\n1 tech point for 1st-level, 2 tech points for 2nd level, etc. You can think of a tech point as a 1st-level spell slot that\ncan be added to other tech points to create a spell slot of a higher level. The number of tech points you can spend\non a spell is limited by your class's level, indicated in the class's progression table.</p>\n<p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended tech points.</p>\n"

    "title": "Casting a Spell",
    "id": "casting_a spell",
    "body": "When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class, the type of spell,\nor the spell's effects.</p>\n<p>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, casting time, range, and duration.\nLevel and load are provided for biotic and tech spells, respectively.</p>\n<p>The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p>\n<h3>Casting Time</h3>\n<p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or even longer to cast.\nCombat spells can require an Attack action to cast.</p>\n<h4>Bonus Action</h4>\n<p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,\nprovided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</p>\n<h4>Reactions</h4>\n<p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response\nto some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p>\n<h4>Attack action</h4>\n<p>Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If\na spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.</p>\n<h4>Longer Casting Times</h4>\n<p>Certain spells require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than\na single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your\nconcentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot or\nspend tech points. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like lance, the target is a creature. For a spell\nlike havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.</p>\n<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.\nOther spells, such as the fortification spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p>\n<p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin\npoint of the spell's effect must be you.</p>\n<p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Components <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip></h3>\n<p>In Mass Effect 5e, all spells are Somatic, meaning they require some amount of gesturing. To cast any of the spell types\na caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p>\n<p>There are no other spell components (such as verbal or material, as in D&amp;D).</p>\n<h3>Duration</h3>\n<p>A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or\neven years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>\n<h4>Instantaneous</h4>\n<p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't\nbe dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.</p>\n<h4>Concentration</h4>\n<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.\nIf you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p>\n<p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long\nyou can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>\n<p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration</strong>. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that\nrequires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Taking damage</strong>. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving\nthrow to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take\ndamage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed</strong>. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n<li>The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as getting sucked out of an airlock, require you\nto succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Targets</h3>\n<p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description\ntells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p>\n<h4>A Clear Path to the Target</h4>\n<p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect\nat a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes\ninto being on the near side of that obstruction.</p>\n<h4>Targeting Yourself</h4>\n<p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically\na creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect\nSpells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p>\n<h3>Areas of Effect</h3>\n<p>Spells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,\ncylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts.\nThe rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in\nspace, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>\n<p>A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point\nof origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.</p>\n<h4>Cone</h4>\n<p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal\nto that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p>\n<p>A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Cube</h4>\n<p>You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as\nthe length of each side.</p>\n<p>A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Cylinder</h4>\n<p>A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description.\nThe circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight\nlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then\nshoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.</p>\n<p>A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.</p>\n<h4>Line</h4>\n<p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p>\n<p>A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Sphere</h4>\n<p>You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as\na radius in feet that extends from the point.</p>\n<p>A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies\nthe ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p>\n<p>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>\n<h3>Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.\nYour attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll\nif you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Casting in Armor</h3>\n<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the\narmor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"101-104\"></source-reference></p>\n"

While they lack advanced combat training, they are the best at defeating enemies without firing a shot. They are outfitted with L5x implants that can spawn a micro-singularity, damaging enemies and pulling them into the air.\n\n## Spell Casting\n### Cantrips\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the adept spell list. You learn additional adept cantrips of\nyour choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Adept table.\n\nInstead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.\n\n### Spell Slots\nThe Adept table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these\nadept spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish\na long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can\ncast lance using either slot.\n\n### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the adept spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more adept spells of your choice. Each of these spells\nmust be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn\none new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the adept spells you know and learn an advanced\nversion of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,\nyou cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.\n\n### Spellcasting Ability\n\nAdepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an Adept, you use your\nWisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the\nsaving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n"
