# v1.0.1


## Character Sheets

- An updated fillable character sheet by [/u/wretchedcrows](https://www.reddit.com/user/wretchedcrows) that is based on the updated character sheet.
- Added an official Google Sheets character sheet, it attempts to strike a balance between Ben's and GameMasterPo's
- Nick S. Fixed some formulas in Ben M's Google Sheets Character Sheet 

## Weapons
Having recently replayed ME1-3, I was reminded that the weapons have an animation when you holster and draw them, transforming from
a compact device into a full weapon and vice versa. Therefore, operatives would be able to carry more than two weapons.

Because of this, I've increased the number of weapon slots to 4. But two-handed weapons take up 2 slots.

## Classes

### Soldier

__Havoc__ subclass's _advanced weapon holsters_ now provide 2 additional weapon slots that can both hold two-handed weapons. 

### Vanguard

__Biotic Maneuvers__ did not say how many maneuvers the player learned initially (it should be 3).

## Backgrounds
- Veteran incorrectly had old (now removed) starship systems as proficiency choices.

## Bestiary

Finally got around to adding all of Dakota P.'s bestiary submissions (Thanks!)
