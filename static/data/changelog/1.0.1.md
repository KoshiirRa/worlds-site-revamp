# v1.0.1


## Character Sheets

- An updated fillable character sheet by [/u/wretchedcrows](https://www.reddit.com/user/wretchedcrows) that is based on the updated character sheet.
- Added an official Google Sheets character sheet, it attempts to strike a balance between Ben's and GameMasterPo's
- Nick S. Fixed some formulas in Ben M's Google Sheets Character Sheet 


## Classes

### Vanguard

__Biotic Maneuvers__ did not say how many maneuvers the player learned initially (it should be 3).

## Backgrounds
- Veteran incorrectly had old (now removed) starship systems as proficiency choices.

## Bestiary

Finally got around to adding all of Dakota P.'s bestiary submissions (Thanks!)

- N7 Slayer
- N7 Shadow
- N7 Paladin
- N7 Demolisher

## Spells
A number of new spells from Ben M. and a new contributor, Chris Alley

- Blade Armor
- Damping
- Flak Cannon
- Gravity Field
- Heavy Charge
- Nanite Cloud
- Pheromone Spray
- Tear
- Trophy System

- Charge: added a note that charge ignores half cover to represent its "semi-teleport" functionality in the ME games
